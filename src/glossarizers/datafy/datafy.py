    """
    Given the download URI for a resource, returns a list of (data, filepath_hint, type_hint) tuples corresponding with
    that resource's dataset contents. Note that in some cases None will substitute for `data` in the above, and that in
    some cases this parameter will size out and simply return None instead of anything at all.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uri: str (required)
        The URI corresponding with the result download link.
    sizeout: int
        Before sending a download request this method will first ask the server for the content-length header of the
        download. If one is provided, and exceeds this parameter in size, this method will simply return None.
    type_hints: (str, str) tuple
        Type hint for the dataset's type. Must be a (mimetype, extension) tuple.
    localized: bool
        Whether or not this file is a local file (e.g. a downloaded file that's sitting on your computer disk). This
        flag should only be used when `get` calls itself `recursively`; it shouldn't be set by the user.

    Returns
    -------
    None or a [{'data': r, 'fp': filepath_hint, 'mime': mime, 'ext': ext}, ...] list.

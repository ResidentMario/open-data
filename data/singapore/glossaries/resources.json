The firms\u2019 views are expressed in terms of directional change(i.e. \"up\", \"same\" or \"down\"). These responses are then weighted and aggregated to derive the weighted percentages for \"up\", \"same\" or \"down\" for each industry. The net weighted balance, which is calculated by the differences between the weighted percentages of \"ups\" and \"downs\" is used to indicated the likely overall direction of change of a particular industry.",

For FY12, Medifund applications for ILTC services were further differentiated into three types of services - i) Non-Residential Services (by attendances), ii) Intermediate Term Residential Services (by admissions), iii) Long Term Residential Services (by bed months) - to better reflect the different nature of the services. The number of ILTC Medifund and Medifund Silver applications in FY12 is a summation of these services in their respective units. Hence FY12 ILTC figures onwards are not comparable with preceding years."

NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type).

        "description": "Every year, all parents, all teachers, and students in grades 6 - 12 take the NYC School Survey. The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. \r\n\r\nSurvey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nThe NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. \r\n\r\nNew York City parents, students, and teachers reached new all-time participation highs on the 2011 School Survey. 960,191 surveys were submitted.",

The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED.  For the most recent cohort, graduation rates as of both June and August (including summer graduates) are reported.   \r\n\r\nRecords with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed.\r\nAugust outcomes are only reported for the most recent cohort. August outcomes include all June and August graduates.\r\nIn school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school\u2019s cohort, but are included in citywide totals.\r\nSchool level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.",

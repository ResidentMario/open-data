This data release includes drinking fountain counts from inspections through 8/3/16.\r\n\r\nTo obtain spatial data for each property refer to the Parks Properties data also posted on the Open Data Portal. Since that data set contains spatial information at the park property level, drinking fountain data will have to be aggregated to the park property level (Property Number) as well.",

The data is collected in the New York Fire Incident Reporting System (NYFIRS), which is structured by the FDNY to provide data to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS).  NFIRS is a modular all-incident reporting system designed by the U.S. Fire Administration. After responding to an incident, FDNY officers complete one or more of the NFIRS modules, depending upon the type of incident. The information in these modules describes the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it.  Although NFIRS was designed specifically to understand the nature and causes of fire, as well as civilian fire casualties and firefighter injuries, it has been expanded to collect basic information on all incidents to which fire units respond.",

OPT staff use a variety of systems to generate and share bus route information with bus vendors and the public. Specific bus route paths cannot be publicly disclosed because they could reveal personally identifiable information about individual students. In this dataset, OPT has provided all the route information that does not risk disclosing personally identifiable information. \r\nSchool-age service for students in grades K through 12 are contracted with bus vendors on a per route basis. OPT also manages bus service for Pre-K students who require curb-to-curb service as per a student\u2019s Individualized Education Plan (IEP). This Pre-K bus service is contracted on a per student basis, instead of per route. As a consequence of this difference, OPT does not design bus routes for Pre-K service, so those routes are not included in this dataset.\r\nThere are a variety of different vehicles used on routes that serve students requiring curb-to-curb service because an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) indicates specific transportation needs. The standard bus is the only vehicle used for general education routes with students eligible for bus service but who do not have an IEP.\r\nUsers may occasionally see a route without a garage assignment. Because this dataset is derived from a snapshot of a transactional system, there may be routes that are in the process of being assigned to a garage. In those cases, the garage information will appear as NULL until the assignment is complete.",

On the NYSED website, results for \"matched\" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022, \"matched\" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th \u2013 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.\r\nIn order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.\r\nFor 2013, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs.

School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults\r\nIn 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam. \r\nFormer English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years. \r\nA change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014 and 2015: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempt from taking the 7th and 8th grade State math assessment. The numbers on the \"All - with Math Regents\" tab represent  the equivalent proficiency had the accelerated math students in 7th and 8th grade taken the State math assessment. An \"All Grades\" row represents how this would impact a school's overall proficiency. Only Districts 1-32 are shown and rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.",

The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. \r\n\r\nIn order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with a cohort of 20 or fewer students are suppressed.\r\nDue to the small number of students identified as Native American or Multi-Racial, these ethnicities are not reported on the Ethnicity tab; however, these students are included in the counts on all other tabs.\r\n4 Year August outcomes are available for the 2004-2011 cohorts at the citywide level and for the 2005-2011 cohorts at the borough, district and school level. 5 Year August outcomes are available for the 2006-2010 cohorts. Cells are blank when data is not available.\r\nCharter schools are not included in the NYSED calculation of graduation rates for NYC.\r\nSchool level results are not presented for District 79 and District 75 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.\r\nStarting with the 2009 cohort (Class of 2013), students with IEPs could use the compensatory score option (CSO) to meet graduation requirements, which contributed to an increase in the graduation rate. \r\nStudents are considered English Language Learners by NY State if classified as an ELL as of graduation.",

The DOE has compiled this data by schools and locations for the information of our parents and students, our teachers and staff, and the general public. \r\nIn some instances, several Department of Education learning communities co-exist within a single building. In other instances, a single school has locations in several different buildings. In either of these instances, the data presented here is aggregated by building location rather than by school, since safety is always a building-wide issue. We use \u201cconsolidated locations\u201d throughout the presentation of the data to indicate the numbers of incidents in buildings that include more than one learning community.",

The 2000\u20132002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.\n3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.\n4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly. \n5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGeneral Obligation:\nGeneral obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTreasury Obligations:\nTreasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTransitional Finance Authority:\nCreated in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:\nIn fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTSASC:\nTSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMunicipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:\nThe Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections of certain sales and compensa",

The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.\n2By law, New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years\u2019 debt service expenses.

For an explanation of these items, and their inclusion in NYC IBO's definition of New York City outstanding debt, please see New Outstanding Debt. \n9In 2006, TSASC restructured its outstanding indebtedness. This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only Series 2006-1 bonds outstanding.\n10MWFA has defeased $14.8 billion of bonds as of June 30, 2012.

            "description": "Early in his tenure at the Law Department, Corporation Counsel Michael A. Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. \r\nTrial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.\r\nLaw Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.\r\nDeposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.",

In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. \r\n\u00b6\u2022Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. \r\n\u00b6\u2022August outcomes include all June and August graduates. \r\n\u00b6\u2022In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school\u2019s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. \r\n\u00b6\u2022School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals. \r\n\u00b6\u2022Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.",

Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. \r\n\r\nThe following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. \r\n\r\nThe Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report.

            "description": "Citywide Class Size Report, including Region, District, School, Program, Grade or Service Category, Average Class Size, and Pupil / Teacher Ratio (PTR) \r\n\r\nSOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)\r\n#Grade 9 not in high schools\r\n##Indicates how special class is delivered\r\n\r\nFor schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. \r\n\r\nThe following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. \r\n\r\nThe Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, \u201ccluster\u201d teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction. Pupil Teacher Ratio Excluding Special Education is calculated by dividing the number of non-special education students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent non-special education teachers.",

The department does not inform the CCRB of its actual disposition date \u2014just the month in which it closed the case. In addition, when the Department Advocate's Office refers a case to a commanding officer for the imposition of a command discipline, the NYPD considers the case closed and reports that closure to the CCRB. It is subsequent to this closure date that the commanding officer decides upon a penalty consistent with the level of command discipline proscribed by the Department Advocate's Office. For cases that proceeded to administrative hearings, the time it takes for judges to render written decisions is included in calculating the department's closure time.\r\nUpdate Schedule: Annually",

Only crashes with valid geographic information are mapped. All midblock crashes are mapped to the nearest intersection. Injuries and fatalities are grouped by intersection and summarized by month and year. This data is queried and aggregated on a monthly basis and is current as of the query date. Current year data is January to the end of the latest full month. All mappable crash data is represented on the simplified NYC street model.

Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nThe NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. \r\n\r\nNew York City parents, students, and teachers reached new all-time participation highs on the 2011 School Survey. 960,191 surveys were submitted.",
